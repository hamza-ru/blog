## 📄 Why Is Report Formatting Important?

A report is not just a required document — it’s a way to **communicate the essence of your work**. Proper formatting improves readability, helps your instructor quickly grasp the content, and creates a strong impression of you as a responsible student.

## 📑 Typical Structure of an Academic Report

Most universities follow a standard report format. The key sections include:

1. **Title Page**  
   University name, course title, report topic, student’s name, group, instructor, year.

2. **Table of Contents**  
   Structure with page numbers for easy navigation.

3. **Introduction**  
   A brief overview of the goal, objectives, and relevance of the work.

4. **Main Body**  
   - Theoretical part (literature review, definitions, approaches)  
   - Practical part (results, calculations, examples, experiments)

5. **Conclusion**  
   Summary of findings, results, and possible future directions.

6. **References**  
   Sources cited, formatted according to university standards (e.g., GOST, APA, or MLA).

7. *(If needed)* **Appendices**  
   Charts, diagrams, code, or additional materials.

## 🧾 Formatting Tips

- Align text **justified**; set paragraph indent to 1.25 cm
- All figures and tables must have **numbering and captions**
- Cite sources correctly using **GOST, APA, or MLA** (as required)

## 💼 Why Formatting Matters Long-Term

Formatting skills are useful beyond university life. They are essential for:

- preparing **academic publications and articles**;  
- demonstrating a **professional attitude** toward work.

## 🏁 Conclusion

Formatting is not a formality — it’s the **visual and logical framework** of your work. It determines how well your ideas are understood and how you’re perceived as an author. Follow the structure, keep things neat, and respect your reader — this is the key to success in any academic writing.
