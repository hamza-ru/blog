## 📘 Week 2 — May 27 to June 2  

**Topics:** Functions and Derivatives, Logical Operations and Truth Tables  

We continued studying derivatives, focusing on differentiation rules and common mistakes. It's surprising how much precision of wording matters in mathematical analysis.

In Mathematical Logic, we learned the basic logical connectors: implication, disjunction, and negation. We practiced building truth tables and proving logical equivalence.

> 🧠 The hardest part was not mixing up “if-then” and “only if.” Logic really does feel like a programming language.
