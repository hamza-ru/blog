## ðŸ“— Week 3 â€” June 3 to June 9  

**Topics:** Derivatives of Composite Functions, Propositional Logic, Loops and Functions in Python  

In Programming, we started writing functions, learning about arguments and return values. I especially enjoyed the assignment where we implemented a recursive factorial function.

In Logic, we moved on to propositional logic and began simplifying expressions using logical laws. It's fascinating how everything can be formalized into basic building blocks.

Mathematical Analysis was rewarding â€” we learned how to find derivatives of composite functions using the chain rule. There were a lot of tasks, but things are starting to make more sense.

> âœ… Successfully passed the first logic quiz â€” 9/10. The key is not to rush and double-check every step.
