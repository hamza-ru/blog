## üìï Week 4 ‚Äî June 10 to June 16  

**Topics:** Programming Practice, Proofs in Logic, Intensive Exam Preparation  

In Programming, we built a calculator using functions and conditionals. Sounds simple, but debugging took a lot of time ‚Äî wrong types, misplaced lines, you name it.

In Logic, we had our first serious test on transforming logical formulas. I messed up the first part a bit but reviewed my mistakes and passed the retake with an excellent score.

In Math Analysis, we‚Äôre actively preparing for the final assessment. We revisited all the differentiation rules and worked through combined problems. Studying in mini-groups and explaining to each other really helps.

> ‚è≥ Realized that consistent effort works better than cramming. Time to rethink my study approach.
