## ðŸ“š Week 1 â€” May 20 to May 26  

**Topics:** Introduction to Programming, Basics of Mathematical Analysis  

This week marked the beginning of serious classes. In Programming, we covered the basics of Python syntax â€” variables, conditionals, and loops. In practice, we wrote simple scripts and trained step-by-step code analysis skills.

In Mathematical Analysis, we got introduced to limits and the definition of the derivative. It was challenging but fascinating â€” the instructor showed how the theory connects to real-world problems in physics.

> ðŸ“Œ Takeaway: without repetition, nothing sticks. Iâ€™ve started taking regular notes and solving extra problems.
