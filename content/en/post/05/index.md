## 📒 Week 5 — June 17 to June 23  

**Topics:** Exams! Programming, Math Analysis, and Logic  

This was the most intense week so far: three exams — one each day. In Programming, we were given a task involving list processing and recursion. I passed with an “excellent” because I solved it using a loop and added an alternative version.

In Mathematical Logic, truth tables saved the day again — we had to prove an implication. I got a bit confused at first but managed to correct it and pass.

Math Analysis was the toughest: problems on finding maximums, minimums, and identifying points of discontinuity. I passed with a “good,” but it was close.

> 🎉 First exam session is over! Summer lies ahead, but I’m already making plans to dive deeper into C++ and algorithm studies.
