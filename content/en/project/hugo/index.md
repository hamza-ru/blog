## 🧑‍🔬 Why does a researcher need a personal website?

In today's academic world, having a personal website is becoming as essential as publishing papers or attending conferences. It's not just a "business card" — it's a tool that allows you to:

- showcase your research interests and achievements;
- collect your publications, projects, talks, and presentations;
- share teaching materials and course content;
- establish connections with colleagues and potential collaborators.

Moreover, a website helps you build a **digital academic identity**, especially if you're just starting your research career.
